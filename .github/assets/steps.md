## ðŸ¤”How to setup?

#### Step 0:
You need to have a GitHub account for the following steps.

#### Step 1:
Fork this repository.
- [**How to fork a repository?**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
- To fork this repository on desktop or mobile browser, kindly click [**here**](https://github.com/SCPF-Archive/repo.1/fork).
> **DO NOT FORK** if you need to set the new repo to private, import this repository instead. I recommend to fork this repo instead of importing so you can update your repository whenever there's an update on the main repository.
