### Notes :
- All the default patches are applied in the applications except for the **~~tasteBuilder-remover~~**, **~~custom-branding~~** and **~~premium-heading~~** patch because I just want it to look normal ðŸ¤¦.
- The **ReVanced Log.7z** contains all the ReVanced applications, archived and compressed for faster download of all the applications.
- The **Micro G** application is needed to be installed in order to run **YouTube** and **YouTube Music** or else it will not work.
- Uninstall your current **Micro G** because the **Micro G** here is updated version, modified from **Team Vanced Micro G** so there will be **signature conflict** if you update your current and old **Micro G** with the latest ones.
- Both the **YouTube Music** and **YouTube** application are non-root variant so don't expect some **Magisk** modules here.
