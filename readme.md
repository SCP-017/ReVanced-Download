## ReVanced Builder

**What?**
- A repository which downloads and patches the supported ReVanced application with the latest ReVanced CLI, Integrations, and Patcher and the applications can be downloaded in the repository release assets.

**Why?**
- Like what [n0k0m3](https://github.com/n0k0m3) said, I also made this repo to help people build ReVanced applications without setting up build environments on their machines or without using the ReVanced Manager.

**How?**
- Actually, I made this repo from scraping scripts and codes from the other repos here on GitHub.

---

## Notes
- The script will download the selected versions ([see here](/revanced/assets/versions)) of applications on **APK Mirror** and **UpToDown**, **NOT** the latest official version on Google Play.
