# ReVanced Builder

**What?**
- A repository which downloads and patches the supported ReVanced application with the latest ReVanced CLI, Integrations, and Patcher and the applications can be downloaded in the repository release assets.

**Why?**
- Like what [**n0k0m3**](https://github.com/n0k0m3) said, I also made this repo to help people build ReVanced applications without setting up build environments on their machines or without using the ReVanced Manager.

**How?**
- Actually, I made this repo from scraping scripts and codes from the other repos here on GitHub so there's no really hard work from this repo.

## üóíÔ∏èNotes

- The script will download the selected versions ([**see here**](/revanced/assets/versions)) of applications on **APK Mirror** and **UpToDown**, **NOT** the latest official version on Google Play.
- The applications are **NON-ROOT** variant so don't expect some **Magisk** modules here.
- Without **microG**, **YouTube** and **YouTube Music** will crash due to missing **microG**, please install **microG**.
