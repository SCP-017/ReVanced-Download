# ReVanced Builder

**What?**
- A repository which downloads and patches the supported ReVanced application with the latest ReVanced CLI, Integrations, and Patcher and the applications can be downloaded in the repository release assets.

**Why?**
- Like what [**n0k0m3**](https://github.com/n0k0m3) said, I also made this repo to help people build ReVanced applications without setting up build environments on their machines or without using the ReVanced Manager.

**How?**
- Actually, I made this repo from scraping scripts and codes from the other repos here on GitHub so there's no really hard work from this repo.

## üóíÔ∏èNotes
<details><summary><b>Click to View</b></summary>

- The script will download the selected versions ([**see here**](/revanced/assets/versions)) of applications on **APK Mirror** and **UpToDown**, **NOT** the latest official version on Google Play.
- The applications are **NON-ROOT** variant so don't expect some **Magisk** modules here.
- Without **microG**, **YouTube** and **YouTube Music** will crash due to missing **microG**, please install **microG**.

#### Step 0:
You need to have a GitHub account for the following steps.

#### Step 1:
Fork this repository.

> **DO NOT FORK** if you need to set the new repo to private, import this repository instead. I recommend to fork this repo instead of importing so you can update your repository whenever there's an update on the main repository.

#### Reminder 1:
Don't forget to always check and update these folders :

- [**Patches Folder**](revanced/assets/patches)
- [**Versions Folder**](revanced/assets/versions)

> Those folders are meant to be checked and updated.

#### Reminder 2:
When you see that you are `# commit/s behind`, update your repo by clicking the `Sync fork` -> `Update branch`.
