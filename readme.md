### Notes :
- All the default patches are applied in the applications except for the **~~tasteBuilder-remover~~**, **~~custom-branding~~** and **~~premium-heading~~** patch because I just want it to look normal ü§¶. To see the full patches that is applied here, [**click here**](https://github.com/SCP-017/ReVanced-Download/tree/main/patches) or [**here**](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches).
- The **ReVanced Log.7z** contains all the ReVanced applications, archived and compressed for faster download of all the applications.
- The **Arch Checker** application is used to identify the phone architecture to install wether YouTube Music ***arm-v7a*** or ***arm64-v8a***.
- The **Micro G** application is needed to be installed in order to run YouTube and YouTube Music or else it will not work.
- Uninstall your current **Micro G** because the **Micro G** here is updated version, modified from **Team Vanced MicroG** so there will be **signature conflict** if you update your current and old **Micro G** with the latest ones.
- Both the **YouTube Music** and **YouTube** application are non-root variant so don't expect some **Magisk** modules here.
